# What?

A very simple **G**raphics **D**evice **I**nterface (short: **GDI**) based Radar.
It can be used for internal and external game cheats.
The API design follows the KISS principle.
It should be usable within most game contexts with a minimal performance impact.

# TODO

There is still some room for performance improvements.
It is not required to redraw the full screen as it is done at the moment.
Only redraw rectangles that changed instead.
